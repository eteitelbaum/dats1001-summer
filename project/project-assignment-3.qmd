## Due dates

Note that the submission instructions and due date for this assignment have changed.

Instead of giving a lightning talk, you are going to submit recorded presentations of 5–7 minutes in length.

The due date for this is the same as the original due date for the assignment (**May 2nd at 11:59 p.m.**).

The due date for the report is now the day of the scheduled final exam for this course (**May 9th at 11:59 p.m.**).

## Overview

For this final assignment, you will synthesize the work completed in Parts 1 and 2 into a polished deliverable that communicates your findings effectively. This assignment has **two components**:

1. **A Quarto RevealJS Presentation**: A lightning talk summarizing your project, findings, and policy implications.
2. **A Final Written Report**: A detailed document that provides a comprehensive overview of your analysis, results, and recommendations.

Together, these components should demonstrate your ability to apply data analysis skills to answer a question relevant to decision-making in a real-world context.

## Component 1: RevealJS Presentation (due May 2nd)

You will create a **5-minute presentation** using Quarto's RevealJS slide deck format. The goal is to provide a concise and engaging summary of your project.

**Rough outline for your presentation:**

- **Slide 1**: Title slide with project title, group member names, and date.
- **Slide 2**: Introduction of your research question and its importance.
- **Slide 3**: Overview of your data, including the source and key variables.
- **Slides 4–5**: Key results, supported by 1–2 visuals (e.g., plots or tables).
- **Slide 6**: Summary of findings and policy implications.

**Tips:**

- Use visuals to make your presentation engaging and accessible.
- Keep text minimal—focus on high-level points and key insights.
- Practice your timing to stay within the 5-minute limit.
- You can add a few more slides if needed, but only if it still allows you to stay within the time limit.

**Submission Instructions:**

- On **May 2nd**, upload your RevealJS presentation to [Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/) and share the link on Discord.
- Also by **May 2nd**, record your presentation using a screen recording tool (e.g., Zoom, Vimeo) and post the link to the recording to Discord or, if you decided to do the writeup/reflection, post that to Discord instead.
- Submit the QMD file for the presentation to Blackboard **on May 9**, along with your full project folder.

## Component 2: Final Written Report (due May 9th)

The final report should be a **3–5 page policy memo** or technical report that provides a detailed narrative of your project. It should build upon Parts 1 and 2, integrating your research question, hypotheses, analysis, and conclusions.

**Your report should include:**

1. **Introduction**
   - Clearly state your research question and why it is important.
   - Provide background context, citing relevant literature or examples.

2. **Data and Methodology**
   - Describe your data sources and key variables (outcome and explanatory).
   - Justify your analytical approach, including the methods used (e.g., regression, hypothesis testing).

3. **Analysis and Results**
   - Present your findings, supported by tables, plots, or statistical results.
   - Include at least one visualization (e.g., regression plot, histogram).

4. **Discussion**
   - Interpret your results in context of your research question and hypotheses.
   - Discuss the statistical significance and implications of your findings.

5. **Policy Implications**
   - Summarize how your findings inform policy or decision-making.
   - Propose actionable recommendations based on your analysis.

6. **Conclusion**
   - Provide a clear answer to your research question.
   - Reflect briefly on limitations and next steps.

**Submission Instructions:**

- Render your report in **HTML** format and upload it to Quarto Pub.
- Submit the link on Discord.
- Upload your group’s zipped project folder (QMD file and data) to Blackboard.
