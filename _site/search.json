You may think you are the only one with a question, but chances are that if you are thinking something so are others in the course;\nDiscord helps to establish a sense of community among students, and we want this course to feel like a modern, supportive and inclusive data science community.\n\nThe TAs and I will check the Discord at least once a day and will respond to your questions as soon as possible.\nPlease do not send emails questions about the course material. Please also do not send direct messages (DMs) or friend requests on Discord. We will only respond to public messages. Although it may be very kind to send them, friend requests will be ignored due to the need to maintain professional boundaries between students and instructors.\nThe link to the Discord server will be distributed at the start of the semester via Blackboard. Please make sure to join the server as soon as possible as the link will expire after a few days.\n\n\nOffice hours\nIf you have asked your question on Discord and could not get an answer, you can come to office hours. You can also come to office hours if you have a personal matter that you would like to discuss. For content-related questions, the TAs will be your first point of contact. If they cannot answer your question, they will refer you to me, at which point you can sign up for one of my office hour slots via Calendly.\nTo make the meeting more effective, you can:\n\nGather materials (assignments, notes, etc.) ready in advance\nBe ready to take notes during office hours\nAsk follow up questions if you need clarification\nConfirm any action plan at the close of the meeting\nFollowing through on any action plan\n\n\n\nEmail\nEmails should be kept to a minimum in this course. But if you have tried the Discord and office hours and still have a question, you can email me. Please make sure to include “DATS 1001” in the subject line of your email.

By following the guidelines and expectations outlined in this syllabus policy, students can maximize the benefits of using LLMs while also demonstrating their own critical thinking, research, and programming skills.\nAs part of this course, students will have the option to use ChatGPT and other LLMs to assist in the writing of their R scripts for specific course assignments. Such tools can provide students with a starting point for their code but often the code is incomplete or error-prone. It is important to recognize that LLMs are a tool and not a substitute for critical thinking, research, or programming skills. Therefore, this syllabus policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for using LLMs in this course.\n\n\nGuidelines\nIt is also important to note that some uses of LLMs are more appropriate than others. For example, it is acceptable to use LLMs to generate boilerplate code or to help with syntax, but it is not acceptable to use an LLM to complete entire assignments or assessments. Students should use LLMs as a starting point and then modify and expand on the generated code to demonstrate their own understanding and skills.\nOne way to think of LLMs is as a tutor or classmate. What would it be appropriate to ask a tutor or classmate for help with? What would you not be permitted ask a tutor or classmate for help with?",

FRED is a comprehensive database of economic data maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The package allows you to search for and download data from FRED directly into R.\nGoogle Public Data Explorer contains information about dozens of databases related to governance and the economy. You cannot download the raw data from Google, but you can use the site to visualize the data and then follow the link to the original source.\nILOSTAT is the statistical database of the International Labour Organisation. It has data pertaining to labor, working conditions, industrial relations, poverty and inequality.\nKaggle has data on just about anything you can think of. Very usable, clean data. Just stick to the social science stuff for your project. You can easily download CSV files from Kaggle but you can also access the data through the Kaggle API.\nOECD DATA provides data related to the performance of high income countries.\nOur World in Data is a good general resource for political economy data. The site is centered around blog posts but you can also search for a topic, view a visualization related to that topic and then download the data used to create it.\npeacesciencer is an R package maintained by Steve Miller that compiles data from a number of sources that are useful for peace and conflict studies analysis\nStatista is a good place to look for data on more niche topics.\nUNCTADstat is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development statistical database. It provides harmonized data on a range of topics related to economic performance, trade and statistics.\nThe UN Human Development Reports include a number of important indicators related to human development, gender and sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nThe unvotes package provides data on United Nations General Assembly voting patterns.\nVarieties of Democracy (V-DEM) provides original measures of the quality of democracy for every country dating back to the 18th century. You can access vdem data through the vdemdata package.\nWorld Bank Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank database for development data from officially-recognized international sources. You can access WB Development Indicators through the WDI package or the wbstats package.\nThe World Bank DataBank provides access to dozens of additional World Bank databases on topics such as regional development, governance, education, gender and the environment. You can access world bank data through the wbstats package.\n\nFor information on more specific resources available, see this page on the Gelman Library website.",

    "text": "The GoBifo Program in Sierra Leone\nSierra Leone was devastated by a civil war lasting from 1991 to 2002. In the post-conflict context, the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development implemented the GoBifo (“forge ahead”) CDD project in Sierra Leone from 2005-2009 (with support from the World Bank and other international donors). See this report for a detailed summary of the program.\nThe program had two key components:\n\nBlock grants of about 4,667 dollars (about 100 per household in each community) that communities could allocate to local development projects, skills trainings, and small-business investment.\n“Technical assistance that promoted democratic decision-making, the participation of socially marginalized women and youth in local politics, and transparent budgeting practices” [@casey2012]\n\nThe GiBifo program also included an impact evaluation, conducted by economists Katherine Casey, Rachel Glennerster, and Edward Miguel. The academic paper generated from the project is in the References section [@casey2012].\nImportantly, the impact evaluation included randomization: communities in the study were randomly assigned to receive the GoBifo program, or not. In this sense, the impact evaluation was similar to a clinical drug trial, where some subjects are randomly assigned to receive the medicine while others do not receive it. This aspect of the design makes it easier to assess the causal impact of this project: we can compare outcomes in the treatment (GoBifo program) and control groups, and test for whether any differences we observe are likely to be due to chance.",

The study team gathered literally hundreds of outcome variables, and the paper includes an interesting discussion of how they analyze the data and interpret the results given the large number of outcomes they measured.\nThe unit of analysis (or row in the dataset) is the village.\nFor our purposes, we will focus on a smaller set of variables, summarized below:\n\nTreatment variable (named t in the data): this equals treatment if the community was randomly assigned to be in the program, and control if not. As a character variable, tidymodels will automatically recognize it as a factor. But be sure to use quotation marks when working with the two categories, e.g. filter(t == \"treatment\").\nCommunity Decision Making Infrastructure: Is there a village development committee in the community? (vdc)\nPublic Goods: Is there a functioning primary school in the community? (f_psch)\nSanitation: Is there a functioning latrine in the community (f_latrine)\nInclusion, Gender equality in participatory decision making (role_wmn).\n\n“Enumerator account of how actively women participated in the deliberation compared to men, ranging from 5 = no difference between women and men to 1 = women not active at all compared to men”\n\nSocial Capital: Trust in other in the community (trust_own)\nConflict: Percentage of respondents in the village that reported they had NO conflicts/disputes with others that required outside intervention (no_conflict)",
