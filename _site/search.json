Please also do not send direct messages (DMs) or friend requests on Discord. I will only respond to public messages. Although it may be very kind to send them, friend requests will be ignored due to the need to maintain professional boundaries between students and instructors.\nThe link to the Discord server will be distributed at the start of the semester via Blackboard. Please make sure to join the server as soon as possible as the link will expire after a few days.\n\n\nOffice hours\nIf you have asked your question on Discord and could not get an answer, you can come to office hours. You can also contact me for an office hours appointment if you have a personal matter that you would like to discuss.\nTo make the meeting more effective, you can:\n\nGather materials (assignments, notes, etc.) ready in advance\nBe ready to take notes during office hours\nAsk follow up questions if you need clarification\nConfirm any action plan at the close of the meeting\nFollowing through on any action plan\n\n\n\nEmail\nEmails should be kept to a minimum in this course.

By following the guidelines and expectations outlined in this syllabus policy, students can maximize the benefits of using LLMs while also demonstrating their own critical thinking, research, and programming skills.\nAs part of this course, students will have the option to use ChatGPT and other LLMs to assist in the writing of their R scripts for specific course assignments. Such tools can provide students with a starting point for their code but often the code is incomplete or error-prone. It is important to recognize that LLMs are a tool and not a substitute for critical thinking, research, or programming skills. Therefore, this syllabus policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for using LLMs in this course.\n\n\nGuidelines\nIt is also important to note that some uses of LLMs are more appropriate than others. For example, it is acceptable to use LLMs to generate boilerplate code or to help with syntax, but it is not acceptable to use an LLM to complete entire assignments or assessments. Students should use LLMs as a starting point and then modify and expand on the generated code to demonstrate their own understanding and skills.\nOne way to think of LLMs is as a tutor or classmate. What would it be appropriate to ask a tutor or classmate for help with? What would you not be permitted ask a tutor or classmate for help with?",

FRED is a comprehensive database of economic data maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The package allows you to search for and download data from FRED directly into R.\nGoogle Public Data Explorer contains information about dozens of databases related to governance and the economy. You cannot download the raw data from Google, but you can use the site to visualize the data and then follow the link to the original source.\nILOSTAT is the statistical database of the International Labour Organisation. It has data pertaining to labor, working conditions, industrial relations, poverty and inequality.\nKaggle has data on just about anything you can think of. Very usable, clean data. Just stick to the social science stuff for your project. You can easily download CSV files from Kaggle but you can also access the data through the Kaggle API.\nOECD DATA provides data related to the performance of high income countries.\nOur World in Data is a good general resource for political economy data. The site is centered around blog posts but you can also search for a topic, view a visualization related to that topic and then download the data used to create it.\npeacesciencer is an R package maintained by Steve Miller that compiles data from a number of sources that are useful for peace and conflict studies analysis\nStatista is a good place to look for data on more niche topics.\nUNCTADstat is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development statistical database. It provides harmonized data on a range of topics related to economic performance, trade and statistics.\nThe UN Human Development Reports include a number of important indicators related to human development, gender and sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nThe unvotes package provides data on United Nations General Assembly voting patterns.\nVarieties of Democracy (V-DEM) provides original measures of the quality of democracy for every country dating back to the 18th century. You can access vdem data through the vdemdata package.\nWorld Bank Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank database for development data from officially-recognized international sources. You can access WB Development Indicators through the WDI package or the wbstats package.\nThe World Bank DataBank provides access to dozens of additional World Bank databases on topics such as regional development, governance, education, gender and the environment. You can access world bank data through the wbstats package.\n\nFor information on more specific resources available, see this page on the Gelman Library website.",

    "text": "The GoBifo Program in Sierra Leone\nSierra Leone was devastated by a civil war lasting from 1991 to 2002. In the post-conflict context, the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development implemented the GoBifo (“forge ahead”) CDD project in Sierra Leone from 2005-2009 (with support from the World Bank and other international donors). See this report for a detailed summary of the program.\nThe program had two key components:\n\nBlock grants of about 4,667 dollars (about 100 per household in each community) that communities could allocate to local development projects, skills trainings, and small-business investment.\n“Technical assistance that promoted democratic decision-making, the participation of socially marginalized women and youth in local politics, and transparent budgeting practices” [@casey2012]\n\nThe GiBifo program also included an impact evaluation, conducted by economists Katherine Casey, Rachel Glennerster, and Edward Miguel. The academic paper generated from the project is in the References section [@casey2012].\nImportantly, the impact evaluation included randomization: communities in the study were randomly assigned to receive the GoBifo program, or not. In this sense, the impact evaluation was similar to a clinical drug trial, where some subjects are randomly assigned to receive the medicine while others do not receive it. This aspect of the design makes it easier to assess the causal impact of this project: we can compare outcomes in the treatment (GoBifo program) and control groups, and test for whether any differences we observe are likely to be due to chance.",

The study team gathered literally hundreds of outcome variables, and the paper includes an interesting discussion of how they analyze the data and interpret the results given the large number of outcomes they measured.\nThe unit of analysis (or row in the dataset) is the village.\nFor our purposes, we will focus on a smaller set of variables, summarized below:\n\nTreatment variable (named t in the data): this equals treatment if the community was randomly assigned to be in the program, and control if not. As a character variable, tidymodels will automatically recognize it as a factor. But be sure to use quotation marks when working with the two categories, e.g. filter(t == \"treatment\").\nCommunity Decision Making Infrastructure: Is there a village development committee in the community? (vdc)\nPublic Goods: Is there a functioning primary school in the community? (f_psch)\nSanitation: Is there a functioning latrine in the community (f_latrine)\nInclusion, Gender equality in participatory decision making (role_wmn).\n\n“Enumerator account of how actively women participated in the deliberation compared to men, ranging from 5 = no difference between women and men to 1 = women not active at all compared to men”\n\nSocial Capital: Trust in other in the community (trust_own)\nConflict: Percentage of respondents in the village that reported they had NO conflicts/disputes with others that required outside intervention (no_conflict)",

RStudio will prompt you when it is time to update and you can follow the same process of downloading and installing from the Posit website that we just did here. For R, there are a number of ways to do it, but the easiest is to use packages like installr for Windows and updateR for Mac. Here is a good blog post that walks you through the steps of how to update R using these packages. I usually update R once a semester.\nWe are going to be using a number of R packages throughout the course. One essential set of packages are those that comprise the Tidyverse, but especially readr, dplyr, ggplot2 and tidyr. You can install the entire Tidyverse collection of packages by typing install.packages(\"tidyverse\") in your console. We will talk about these packages in detail as we go through the course, but have a look at this basic description now to gain some basic familiarity.\nAnother thing that you really want to do is to make sure that you have the native pipe operator (|&gt;) enabled. In RStudio, go to Tools&gt;Global Options, then go to Code and select “Use native pipe operator.”\nWhile you are here, you can also go to Appearance to select a different editor theme or to Pane Layout to change how the four panes in R Studio are organized. Next, familiarize yourself with how to expand and minimize the four windows. The most important window that I want to highlight here is the source window. This is where we are going to be working most of the time in this course. And if I tell you to send your source code, I mean to send the file that you are working on in this window. This could be a Quarto document, an R script or an app.R file for a Shiny app.\nThe next window is the Console and there we also see tabs for Terminal and Background Jobs. The console is where you can run R code one line at a time. The terminal is relevant for more advanced users and we will make some use of it when we talk about publishing Quarto documents. Background Jobs is going to be helpful when we want troubleshoot a Quarto document that is not rendering properly.\nFrom there, the next pane we want to explore is Environment, History, etc. Environment tells us what files are currently available to us. The other important tab here is Git which will be where we push things to GitHub.

Plots is a window for viewing our visualizations. And Packages shows us what packages are available and loaded into our environment.\nBefore you move on to the next section, take some time to familiarize yourself with the various user-friendly buttons and shortcuts available to you like the drop down menu for the pane layout, a spell checker, a button for inserting a code chunk and other features that you can play around with."

    "section": "Quarto",
    "text": "Quarto\n\nOnce you have R, R Studio and Quarto installed, you are ready to start integrating text and code with Quarto. Quarto is an open source publishing platform that enables you to integrate text with code. If you have used R Markdown before then Quarto will look familiar to you because Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown.\nRStudio comes with a version of Quarto already installed, but it can be useful to install the most recent version separately and because doing so will allow you to use Quarto with another IDE like VS Code. You can install the most recent version of Quarto by visiting this page and selecting the version for your operating system.\nNow take a little time to create a Quarto project in R Studio and make sure everything is working properly. But before you get started, create a new folder(directory) for this course on your computer somewhere. Once that is done, go to File &gt; New Project. Then select Quarto Project and name the project something like “test-project” in the Directory name field. Next, select Browse and navigate to the folder that you created for this course. Select Create Project.\nYou will notice that in your new project folder there is a file with an .Rproj extension. The .Rproj file is what tells RStudio which files are associated with the project and it obviates the need to set the working directory. It also makes it possible to share the folder with anyone who is running R and RStudio and have them run your code without having to set a working directory. This is what we refer to as a project-based workflow and we will use it for every assignment in this class.\nNow try rendering the document with the Render toggle button. By default, Quarto renders an .html file that it will open in a browser and save to your project folder.\nNext we want to try rendering a .pdf document. To do this, we have to install tinytex, a lightweight version of LaTeX. To do this, go to the Terminal and type quarto install tinytex. Now, change the format from html to pdf by inserting format: pdf in the YAML header. Then render the document again. A .pdf document should open up.\nNow take a few minutes and try changing more of the code in the YAML header. You can try changing the title, adding a subtitle (subtitle:) or changing the execution options. By default, Quarto uses the visual editor but behind the scenes it is using Markdown. Try and edit some text using the toggle buttons available in the visual editor and then switch to Source to view the underlying Markdown code. Play with the R code chunks embedded in the document or try adding new code chunks.\nYou may already have some experience writing in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that enables you to format plaintext files. If you have not used Markdown, or if your memory is hazy, don’t worry: it is really easy to learn. Have a look at this Markdown cheat sheet and try to familiarize yourself with its basic syntax. Finally, take some time to get familiar with the Guide and Reference sections of the Quarto website. Then take a look at the gallery so that you can get an idea of the kinds of things you can produce with Quarto."

    "text": "GitHub and GitHub Classroom\n\nGitHub is a platform for hosting version control repositories. In this course we will learn to use GitHub to store, manage and collaborate on code.\nOne central concept you want to be familiar with is a repository or “repo” for short. Repos are essentially folders where code can be stored and then accessed and changed by multiple users. All of the assignments for this course will be managed in repos.\nGitHub repos are managed using a version control system named Git. Git allows developers to make and track changes to the code stored in the repo. Git also enables users to create branches to work on the code without affecting the main codebase and then merge those changes back into the main branch when they are ready.\nThe first thing you are going to want to do is to register a GitHub account. From there, you want to install Git and initiate Git using the usethis package. Be sure to install usethis first (install.packages(\"usethis\")) if you don’t have it installed already. Then load usethis (library(usethis)) and type use_git_config(user.name = \"Jane Doe\", user.email = \"jane@example.org\") substituting the name and email associated with your GitHub account.\nNext, you need to generate a personal access token (PAT) by typing create_github_token() and set your credentials with the gitcreds package. This is pretty simple once you have your PAT. After installing and loading gitcreds (install.packages(\"gitcreds\"); library(gitcreds)), you can type gitcreds_get() to see whether you already have credentials set up. Then type gitcreds_set() to enter your new credentials (your username and your password, which will be the PAT that you just generated).\nNow, you can create a GitHub repo and clone it to your computer in RStudio. There a number of ways to clone a repo, but the recommended method for this course involves creating a new project in RStudio and selecting “Version Control” for the method (instead of “New Directory” as we did before). From there, select “Git”, copy the URL from the green “Code” tab in the GitHub repo, and paste it into “Repository URL” field. Next, select the directory where you want the repository to be created and click “create project.”\nFor our purposes all of your repos will be private repos in the GitHub Classroom environment. To access them, simply click on the invitation link that you see for the coding assignment in the relevant module on Blackboard. This should take you directly to the repo. Then you can clone it using the steps outlined in the previous paragrah."
