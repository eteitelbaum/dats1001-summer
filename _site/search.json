Please also do not send direct messages (DMs) or friend requests on Discord. I will only respond to public messages. Although it may be very kind to send them, friend requests will be ignored due to the need to maintain professional boundaries between students and instructors.\nThe link to the Discord server will be distributed at the start of the semester via Blackboard. Please make sure to join the server as soon as possible as the link will expire after a few days.\n\n\nOffice hours\nIf you have asked your question on Discord and could not get an answer, you can come to office hours. You can also contact me for an office hours appointment if you have a personal matter that you would like to discuss.\nTo make the meeting more effective, you can:\n\nGather materials (assignments, notes, etc.) ready in advance\nBe ready to take notes during office hours\nAsk follow up questions if you need clarification\nConfirm any action plan at the close of the meeting\nFollowing through on any action plan\n\n\n\nEmail\nEmails should be kept to a minimum in this course.

By following the guidelines and expectations outlined in this syllabus policy, students can maximize the benefits of using LLMs while also demonstrating their own critical thinking, research, and programming skills.\nAs part of this course, students will have the option to use ChatGPT and other LLMs to assist in the writing of their R scripts for specific course assignments. Such tools can provide students with a starting point for their code but often the code is incomplete or error-prone. It is important to recognize that LLMs are a tool and not a substitute for critical thinking, research, or programming skills. Therefore, this syllabus policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for using LLMs in this course.\n\n\nGuidelines\nIt is also important to note that some uses of LLMs are more appropriate than others. For example, it is acceptable to use LLMs to generate boilerplate code or to help with syntax, but it is not acceptable to use an LLM to complete entire assignments or assessments. Students should use LLMs as a starting point and then modify and expand on the generated code to demonstrate their own understanding and skills.\nOne way to think of LLMs is as a tutor or classmate. What would it be appropriate to ask a tutor or classmate for help with? What would you not be permitted ask a tutor or classmate for help with?",

    "text": "Here are some datasets that you might consider using for your final project:\n\nfredr is an R package that provides access to the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. FRED is a comprehensive database of economic data maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The package allows you to search for and download data from FRED directly into R.\nGoogle Public Data Explorer contains information about dozens of databases related to governance and the economy. You cannot download the raw data from Google, but you can use the site to visualize the data and then follow the link to the original source.\nILOSTAT is the statistical database of the International Labour Organisation. It has data pertaining to labor, working conditions, industrial relations, poverty and inequality.\nKaggle has data on just about anything you can think of. Very usable, clean data. Just stick to the social science stuff for your project. You can easily download CSV files from Kaggle but you can also access the data through the Kaggle API.\nOECD DATA provides data related to the performance of high income countries.\nOur World in Data is a good general resource for political economy data. The site is centered around blog posts but you can also search for a topic, view a visualization related to that topic and then download the data used to create it.\npeacesciencer is an R package maintained by Steve Miller that compiles data from a number of sources that are useful for peace and conflict studies analysis\nStatista is a good place to look for data on more niche topics.\nUNCTADstat is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development statistical database. It provides harmonized data on a range of topics related to economic performance, trade and statistics.\nThe UN Human Development Reports include a number of important indicators related to human development, gender and sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nThe unvotes package provides data on United Nations General Assembly voting patterns.\nVarieties of Democracy (V-DEM) provides original measures of the quality of democracy for every country dating back to the 18th century. You can access vdem data through the vdemdata package.\nWorld Bank Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank database for development data from officially-recognized international sources. You can access WB Development Indicators through the WDI package or the wbstats package.\nThe World Bank DataBank provides access to dozens of additional World Bank databases on topics such as regional development, governance, education, gender and the environment. You can access world bank data through the wbstats package.\n\nFor information on more specific resources available, see this page on the Gelman Library website.",

    "text": "The GoBifo Program in Sierra Leone\nSierra Leone was devastated by a civil war lasting from 1991 to 2002. In the post-conflict context, the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development implemented the GoBifo (“forge ahead”) CDD project in Sierra Leone from 2005-2009 (with support from the World Bank and other international donors). See this report for a detailed summary of the program.\nThe program had two key components:\n\nBlock grants of about 4,667 dollars (about 100 per household in each community) that communities could allocate to local development projects, skills trainings, and small-business investment.\n“Technical assistance that promoted democratic decision-making, the participation of socially marginalized women and youth in local politics, and transparent budgeting practices” [@casey2012]\n\nThe GiBifo program also included an impact evaluation, conducted by economists Katherine Casey, Rachel Glennerster, and Edward Miguel. The academic paper generated from the project is in the References section [@casey2012].\nImportantly, the impact evaluation included randomization: communities in the study were randomly assigned to receive the GoBifo program, or not. In this sense, the impact evaluation was similar to a clinical drug trial, where some subjects are randomly assigned to receive the medicine while others do not receive it. This aspect of the design makes it easier to assess the causal impact of this project: we can compare outcomes in the treatment (GoBifo program) and control groups, and test for whether any differences we observe are likely to be due to chance.",

The study team gathered literally hundreds of outcome variables, and the paper includes an interesting discussion of how they analyze the data and interpret the results given the large number of outcomes they measured.\nThe unit of analysis (or row in the dataset) is the village.\nFor our purposes, we will focus on a smaller set of variables, summarized below:\n\nTreatment variable (named t in the data): this equals treatment if the community was randomly assigned to be in the program, and control if not. As a character variable, tidymodels will automatically recognize it as a factor. But be sure to use quotation marks when working with the two categories, e.g. filter(t == \"treatment\").\nCommunity Decision Making Infrastructure: Is there a village development committee in the community? (vdc)\nPublic Goods: Is there a functioning primary school in the community? (f_psch)\nSanitation: Is there a functioning latrine in the community (f_latrine)\nInclusion, Gender equality in participatory decision making (role_wmn).\n\n“Enumerator account of how actively women participated in the deliberation compared to men, ranging from 5 = no difference between women and men to 1 = women not active at all compared to men”\n\nSocial Capital: Trust in other in the community (trust_own)\nConflict: Percentage of respondents in the village that reported they had NO conflicts/disputes with others that required outside intervention (no_conflict)",

Students will begin with data visualization, learning the essential tools and principles for creating informative and impactful visual representations of data. The course then progresses to data wrangling, where students will clean, manipulate, and prepare data for analysis.\nAs the semester unfolds, students will explore web scraping techniques to gather data from online sources, followed by an examination of the ethical considerations surrounding data collection, privacy, and algorithmic bias. The course then delves into statistical modeling, introducing both linear and logistic regression, and other core methods used in predictive analytics.\nThroughout the course, various special topics, such as bootstrapping, randomization tests, or interactive web applications, will be covered, offering students a chance to explore current trends and tools in data science. The curriculum is designed to equip students with a versatile toolkit, enabling them to tackle real-world data challenges and communicate their findings effectively.",

    "section": "Quarto",
    "text": "Quarto\n\nOnce you have R, R Studio and Quarto installed, you are ready to start integrating text and code with Quarto. Quarto is an open source publishing platform that enables you to integrate text with code. If you have used R Markdown before then Quarto will look familiar to you because Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown.\nRStudio comes with a version of Quarto already installed, but it can be useful to install the most recent version separately and because doing so will allow you to use Quarto with another IDE like VS Code. You can install the most recent version of Quarto by visiting this page and selecting the version for your operating system.\nNow take a little time to create a Quarto project in R Studio and make sure everything is working properly. But before you get started, create a new folder(directory) for this course on your computer somewhere. Once that is done, go to File &gt; New Project. Then select Quarto Project and name the project something like “test-project” in the Directory name field. Next, select Browse and navigate to the folder that you created for this course. Select Create Project.\nYou will notice that in your new project folder there is a file with an .Rproj extension. The .Rproj file is what tells RStudio which files are associated with the project and it obviates the need to set the working directory. It also makes it possible to share the folder with anyone who is running R and RStudio and have them run your code without having to set a working directory. This is what we refer to as a project-based workflow and we will use it for every assignment in this class.\nNow try rendering the document with the Render toggle button. By default, Quarto renders an .html file that it will open in a browser and save to your project folder. Next we want to try rendering a .pdf document. To do this, we have to install tinytex, a lightweight version of LaTeX. To do this, go to the Terminal and type quarto install tinytex. Now, change the format from html to pdf by inserting format: pdf in the YAML header. Then render the document again. A .pdf document should open up.\nNow take a few minutes and try changing more of the code in the YAML header. You can try changing the title, adding a subtitle (subtitle:) or changing the execution options. By default, Quarto uses the visual editor but behind the scenes it is using Markdown. Try and edit some text using the toggle buttons available in the visual editor and then switch to Source to view the underlying Markdown code. Play with the R code chunks embedded in the document or try adding new code chunks.\nYou may already have some experience writing in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that enables you to format plaintext files. If you have not used Markdown, or if your memory is hazy, don’t worry: it is really easy to learn. Have a look at this Markdown cheat sheet and try to familiarize yourself with its basic syntax. Finally, take some time to get familiar with the Guide and Reference sections of the Quarto website. Then take a look at the gallery so that you can get an idea of the kinds of things you can produce with Quarto."

    "text": "GitHub and GitHub Classroom\n\nGitHub is a platform for hosting version control repositories. In this course we will learn to use GitHub to store, manage and collaborate on code.\nOne central concept you want to be familiar with is a repository or “repo” for short. Repos are essentially folders where code can be stored and then accessed and changed by multiple users. All of the assignments for this course will be managed in repos.\nGitHub repos are managed using a version control system named Git. Git allows developers to make and track changes to the code stored in the repo. Git also enables users to create branches to work on the code without affecting the main codebase and then merge those changes back into the main branch when they are ready.\nThe first thing you are going to want to do is to register a GitHub account. From there, you want to install Git and initiate Git using the usethis package. Be sure to install usethis first (install.packages(\"usethis\")) if you don’t have it installed already. Then load usethis (library(usethis)) and type use_git_config(user.name = \"Jane Doe\", user.email = \"jane@example.org\") substituting the name and email associated with your GitHub account.\nNext, you need to generate a personal access token (PAT) by typing create_github_token() and set your credentials with the gitcreds package. This is pretty simple once you have your PAT. After installing and loading gitcreds (install.packages(\"gitcreds\"); library(gitcreds)), you can type gitcreds_get() to see whether you already have credentials set up. Then type gitcreds_set() to enter your new credentials (your username and your password, which will be the PAT that you just generated).\nNow, you can create a GitHub repo and clone it to your computer in RStudio. There a number of ways to clone a repo, but the recommended method for this course involves creating a new project in RStudio and selecting “Version Control” for the method (instead of “New Directory” as we did before). From there, select “Git”, copy the URL from the green “Code” tab in the GitHub repo, and paste it into “Repository URL” field. Next, select the directory where you want the repository to be created and click “create project.”\nFor our purposes all of your repos will be private repos in the GitHub Classroom environment. To access them, simply click on the invitation link that you see for the coding assignment in the relevant module on Blackboard. This should take you directly to the repo. Then you can clone it using the steps outlined in the previous paragrah."

But as your analysis grows more complex or involves collaborators, maintaining an organized file structure becomes essential. A good Quarto project keeps all your materials—data, scripts, and reports—in a consistent, portable format. This not only helps avoid broken file paths, but also supports reproducibility, sharing, and long-term clarity.\nA typical layout might include your main .qmd document, a data/ folder for input files, a separate folder for images or plots, and a designated location for rendered outputs. Keeping everything bundled in a single project folder also makes it easier to track changes and collaborate via Git or GitHub."

For example:\ntitle: \"My Report\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: today\nformat: html\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  message: false\nHere, the title, author, and date fields define the document header. The format field tells Quarto what type of file to create—HTML in this case. The execute section controls global options for code chunks. In this example, code won’t be shown (echo: false) and messages will be suppressed (message: false). These defaults apply to all chunks in the document, though individual chunks can override them."

    "text": "Authoring with Markdown\nQuarto documents are written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language designed for readability. You don’t need to remember complex formatting commands. To create section headings, you simply use hash signs—# for the main title, ## for sections, and so on. Italics and bold are created with asterisks, like *italic* and **bold**.\n\nYou can also create numbered or unnumbered lists by just typing them directly, and you can include links with [text](https://quarto.org) syntax. Images work the same way—just add an exclamation mark in front, like ![](images/myplot.png). The goal is to keep your writing clear and uncluttered while supporting rich formatting features."

    "text": "Code Chunks in Depth\nOne of the key advantages of Quarto is the ability to weave together code and prose. You can insert a code chunk by typing three backticks and specifying the language, like this:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\nThere are also a couple of shortcuts you can use to create code chunks in RStudio. You can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (or Cmd + Option + I on Mac) to insert a code chunk, or you can go to the menu bar and select on this icon:\n\n\n\n\nYou can also control how chunks behave using chunk options. Quarto supports a special #| syntax that lets you configure each chunk individually. For instance, you can use #| echo: to control whether the code is displayed along with the output, or #| label: to add a label to a code chunk (labels can be useful if you want to identify where an error is coming from or to reuse code from a chunk).\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we’ve given the chunk a label (mtcars_plot) and hidden the code from the final output using echo: false. Notice how in the rendered version the first chunk shows the code but the second and third do not. This is useful when you want to show the results—like a plot—without showing the code that generated it. You can also hide messages, warnings, and even outputs in a similar way."

    "text": "Quarto\n\nOnce you have R, R Studio and Quarto installed, you are ready to start integrating text and code with Quarto. Quarto is an open source publishing platform that enables you to integrate text with code. If you have used R Markdown before then Quarto will look familiar to you because Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown.\nRStudio comes with a version of Quarto already installed, but it can be useful to install the most recent version separately and because doing so will allow you to use Quarto with another IDE like VS Code. You can install the most recent version of Quarto by visiting this page and selecting the version for your operating system.\nNow take a little time to create a Quarto project in R Studio and make sure everything is working properly. But before you get started, create a new folder(directory) for this course on your computer somewhere. Once that is done, go to File &gt; New Project. Then select Quarto Project and name the project something like “test-project” in the Directory name field. Next, select Browse and navigate to the folder that you created for this course. Select Create Project.\nYou will notice that in your new project folder there is a file with an .Rproj extension. The .Rproj file is what tells RStudio which files are associated with the project and it obviates the need to set the working directory. It also makes it possible to share the folder with anyone who is running R and RStudio and have them run your code without having to set a working directory. This is what we refer to as a project-based workflow and we will use it for every assignment in this class.\nNow try rendering the document with the Render toggle button. By default, Quarto renders an .html file that it will open in a browser and save to your project folder. Next we want to try rendering a .pdf document. To do this, we have to install tinytex, a lightweight version of LaTeX. To do this, go to the Terminal and type quarto install tinytex. Now, change the format from html to pdf by inserting format: pdf in the YAML header. Then render the document again. A .pdf document should open up.\nNow take a few minutes and try changing more of the code in the YAML header. You can try changing the title, adding a subtitle (subtitle:) or changing the execution options. By default, Quarto uses the visual editor but behind the scenes it is using Markdown. Try and edit some text using the toggle buttons available in the visual editor and then switch to Source to view the underlying Markdown code. Play with the R code chunks embedded in the document or try adding new code chunks.\nYou may already have some experience writing in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that enables you to format plaintext files. If you have not used Markdown, or if your memory is hazy, don’t worry: it is really easy to learn. Have a look at this Markdown cheat sheet and try to familiarize yourself with its basic syntax. Finally, take some time to get familiar with the Guide and Reference sections of the Quarto website. Then take a look at the gallery so that you can get an idea of the kinds of things you can produce with Quarto."

    "text": "Objects in R\nIn R, everything is an object. An object is a named container that stores data or functions and associated metadata. Objects can hold simple data like numbers or more complex structures like vectors, lists, or data frames.\nYou create an object using the assignment operator &lt;-. To take a simple example from earlier in this module, we can take the sum of 2 and 2 and assign it to an object called sum_of_2plus2:\n\nsum_of_2plus2 &lt;- 2 + 2\n\nNow that we have the object created we can do lots of things with it. We could simply print what is in the object by calling it (printing it out) in another code chunk:\n\nsum_of_2plus2\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the console, you need to use print() to display the contents of an object. In Quarto, you can just type the name of the object and it will print it out for you.\n\n\nOr we could use it in another calculation. For example, we could multiply it by 2:\n\nsum_of_2plus2 * 2\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nWe could then assign that to another object:\n\nsum_of_2plus2_times_2 &lt;- sum_of_2plus2 * 2\n\nAnd so on… But we can store lots of things in objects, not just 2 + 2. For example, we can store a string in an object. Let’s store the string “Hello, world!” in an object called my_string and then print it out:\n\nmy_string &lt;- \"Hello, world!\"\n\nmy_string\n\n[1] \"Hello, world!\"\n\n\nSometimes you want to store more than one number. In this case you can store a vector. A vector is a collection of numbers or characters. You can create a vector using the c() function, which stands for “combine.” For example, to create a vector of numbers from 1 to 5, you would do:\n\nmy_vector &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nmy_vector\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5"

Let’s take the mean of the vector that we created earlier:\n\nmean(my_vector)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nHere we see that the mean of c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is 3. Some common functions in R include:\n\n\nmean() calculates the mean of a set of numbers\n\nmedian() calculates the median of a set of numbers\n\nsd() calculates the standard deviation of a set of numbers\n\nsum() calculates the sum of a set of numbers\n\nlength() calculates the length of a vector\n\nmax() and min() calculate the maximum and minimum values of a vector\n\nround() rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places\n\nsqrt() calculates the square root of a number\n\nlog() calculates the natural logarithm of a number\n\nexp() calculates the exponential of a number\n\nabs() calculates the absolute value of a number\n\nYou can even create your own functions in R. For example, we could create a function that takes a number and returns its square:\n\nsquare &lt;- function(x) {\n  x^2\n}\n\nThen you can use this function to square any number:\n\nsquare(2)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nCreating functions is somewhat of an advanced topic, but it is a very useful one.

    "text": "Data Frames\n\nA data frame is a two-dimensional table-like structure that can hold different types of data. Each column can contain different types of data (e.g., numeric, character, factor), and each row represents an observation. Data frames are one of the most common data structures in R and are used to store and manipulate datasets.\nTo create a data frame, you can use the data.frame() function. For example, let’s create a simple data frame with two columns: x and y:\n\nmy_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\"),\n  age = c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45),\n  height = c(5.5, 6.0, 5.8, 5.9, 5.7),\n  starwars_fan = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n)\n\nHere we have a data frame with 5 rows and 4 columns. The first column is a character vector (name), the second (age) and third (height) columns are numeric vectors, and the last column (starwars_fan) is a logical vector. You can print out the data frame by simply typing its name:\n\nmy_data\n\n     name age height starwars_fan\n1   Alice  25    5.5         TRUE\n2     Bob  30    6.0        FALSE\n3 Charlie  35    5.8         TRUE\n4   David  40    5.9        FALSE\n5     Eve  45    5.7         TRUE\n\n\nNow you can access individual columns or rows of the data frame using the $ operator or by using indexing. For example, to access the age column, you can do:\n\nmy_data$age\n\n[1] 25 30 35 40 45\n\n\nYou may also see people using indexing to access columns. For example, you can access the first column of the data frame using:\n\nmy_data[, 1]\n\n[1] \"Alice\"   \"Bob\"     \"Charlie\" \"David\"   \"Eve\"    \n\n\nWe will learn a lot more about manipulating data frames in subsequent modules when we talk about the dplyr package. For now, just know that data frames are a powerful and flexible way to store and manipulate data in R."

The Tidyverse represents not just a collection of tools but also a philosophy about how data analysis should be approached—with consistency, clarity, and a focus on human readability. To get a better sense of what the it is all about, watch this video of Hadley Wickham, the creator of the Tidyverse, discussing the importance of code maintenance and the evolution of the Tidyverse.\n\nIn this module, you’ll begin your journey with several core Tidyverse packages that form the foundation of data science work. While we will touch on most of the Tidyverse packages in this, course, there are four that are essential for our work:\n\n\nreadr streamlines the process of importing data into R\n\ndplyr provides intuitive verbs for data manipulation and transformation\n\nggplot2 enables creation of beautiful visualizations using the grammar of graphics\n\ntidyr will be helpful when we want to reshape (pivot) our data Today, we are going to get a general sense of the Tidyverse. We will also talk about how to use the readr package to read data into R and a couple of ways to view the contents of the data frame. Then we will cover ggplot2 in the next couple of modules and dplyr and tidyr will come into focus next week when we turn to data wrangling."

    "text": "Working with Tidyverse Packages\nWhen using Tidyverse packages, you have a few options for how to load and access their functions.\nInitially, we’ll load individual packages as needed. This approach helps you understand which functions come from which packages and allows you to be selective about which parts of the Tidyverse you’re using.\nFor example, to load the ggplot2 package you would go:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nAs you become more comfortable with the Tidyverse ecosystem, you might prefer to load all the core packages at once:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nThis command loads all of the core Tidyverse packages, including readr, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and others.\nSometimes you might see code where the author loads a package using its namespace by using the :: operator, like this:\n\nggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2))\n\nThis will not be as common a workflow for us, but it is helpful in context where you want to use a function from a package without loading the entire package. This can be helpful when putting code into production or writing packages because it helps to avoid conflicts between functions and minimize resources."

    "text": "Reading Data into R\nThe first step in most data analysis projects is importing your data. The readr package makes this process straightforward and efficient, especially when working with CSV files, which are one of the most common data formats.\nLet’s start by loading the readr package and importing a dataset about democracy measures around the world. Download this data set and move it in your project folder as dem_summary.csv:\n📥 Download dem_summary.csv\nA best practice is to save your data files in a subfolder within your project directory. Usually we would call that folder “data” and reference the file as data/name_of_file.csv. This keeps your workspace organized and makes it easier to find your data files later.\nNow try reading in the data and storing it in an object using the read_csv() function from the readr package like this:\n\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndem_summary &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_summary.csv\")\n\nWhen you run this code, readr will display a message showing how it interpreted each column (e.g., as character, numeric, etc.). This is helpful for quickly identifying if any columns were parsed incorrectly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe could also have used the base R read function read.csv() to read in the data, but read_csv() is generally faster and more efficient. It also has a number of advantages over the base R function. For example, it automatically handles column types, so you don’t have to specify them manually. read_csv() also provides better handling of missing values and other common issues that can arise when importing data."

    "text": "Viewing the Data\nOnce you’ve imported your data, it’s important to take a look at it to ensure everything looks correct. One way to do this is to type View() in your console or (equivalently) click on the name of the object in your Environment tab to see the data in a spreadsheet:\n\n\n\n\nThis will open a new tab in RStudio with a spreadsheet-like view of your data frame. This is a great way to get a quick overview of your data.\nThe glimpse() function from the dplyr package is another great way to get an overview of your data frame. It provides a quick summary of the data, including the number of rows and columns, the names of the columns, and the data types of each column.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndem_summary &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_summary.csv\")\n\nglimpse(dem_summary)\n\nRows: 6\nColumns: 5\n$ region    &lt;chr&gt; \"The West\", \"Latin America\", \"Eastern Europe\", \"Asia\", \"Afri…\n$ polyarchy &lt;dbl&gt; 0.8709230, 0.6371358, 0.5387451, 0.4076602, 0.3934166, 0.245…\n$ gdp_pc    &lt;dbl&gt; 37.913054, 9.610284, 12.176554, 9.746391, 4.410484, 21.134319\n$ flfp      &lt;dbl&gt; 52.99082, 48.12645, 50.45894, 50.32171, 56.69530, 26.57872\n$ women_rep &lt;dbl&gt; 28.12921, 21.32548, 17.99728, 14.45225, 17.44296, 10.21568\n\n\nHere we see that the data frame consists of five columns: region; polyarchy (a measure of democracy); GDP per capita (gdp_pc); female labor force participation rates (flfp); and levels of women’s representation (women_rep). We also see that region is a character variable and the other four columns are numeric variables. Finally, we see that there are six rows in the data frame representing the average values of these variables for each region in the world.\nNote that there are some other base R functions that can be useful for viewing data frames. You can use the head() function to view the first few rows of a data frame:\n\nhead(dem_summary)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  region         polyarchy gdp_pc  flfp women_rep\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 The West           0.871  37.9   53.0      28.1\n2 Latin America      0.637   9.61  48.1      21.3\n3 Eastern Europe     0.539  12.2   50.5      18.0\n4 Asia               0.408   9.75  50.3      14.5\n5 Africa             0.393   4.41  56.7      17.4\n6 Middle East        0.246  21.1   26.6      10.2\n\n\nYou can also use the tail() function to view the last few rows of a data frame:\n\ntail(dem_summary)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  region         polyarchy gdp_pc  flfp women_rep\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 The West           0.871  37.9   53.0      28.1\n2 Latin America      0.637   9.61  48.1      21.3\n3 Eastern Europe     0.539  12.2   50.5      18.0\n4 Asia               0.408   9.75  50.3      14.5\n5 Africa             0.393   4.41  56.7      17.4\n6 Middle East        0.246  21.1   26.6      10.2\n\n\nAnd the summary() function to get a summary of the data frame, including the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values for each column:\n\nsummary(dem_summary)\n\n    region            polyarchy          gdp_pc            flfp      \n Length:6           Min.   :0.2459   Min.   : 4.410   Min.   :26.58  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:0.3970   1st Qu.: 9.644   1st Qu.:48.68  \n Mode  :character   Median :0.4732   Median :10.961   Median :50.39  \n                    Mean   :0.5156   Mean   :15.832   Mean   :47.53  \n                    3rd Qu.:0.6125   3rd Qu.:18.895   3rd Qu.:52.36  \n                    Max.   :0.8709   Max.   :37.913   Max.   :56.70  \n   women_rep    \n Min.   :10.22  \n 1st Qu.:15.20  \n Median :17.72  \n Mean   :18.26  \n 3rd Qu.:20.49  \n Max.   :28.13"

The basic idea behind it is that data visualization has a language with its own grammar, and that the elements of this grammar can be combined in a systematic way to create a wide variety of visualizations.\nThe basic components of a ggplot2 visualization are the data that you want to visualize, the aesthetics (or dimensions) of the visualization, the geometric objects (or geoms) that you want to use to represent the data, and various other elements like color scales, themes, and annotations. As you will see, each of these elments is “added” onto the plot in a systematic way quite literally using the + sign."

Our aim here is going to be to summarize levels of democracy across different regions like we did in the last lesson, but this time we will illustrate the differences with a chart.\nWe will start by loading in the dem_summary.csv file that we made in the last lesson. You should already have it stored in your data subfolder for this module. But just in case here it is again:\n📥 Download dem_summary.csv\nNext we will use these data for our first ggplot() call. The ggplot() function takes two arguments: data and mapping. data refers to the data frame that includes the variables we want to visualize and mapping refers to the aesthetics mappings for the visualization. The aesthetics mappings are themselves presented in a quoting function aes() that defines the x and y values of the plot along with other aesthetic values like fill, color and linetype. We will focus on x and y values here and return to these additional aesthetic values later.\nAfter our ggplot() call, we can add a series of additional functions to define our visualization following a + sign. The most important group are the geoms which will define the basic type of plot we want to make. In this case, we are calling geom_col() for our histogram and specifying that the fill color should be “steelblue.”\nFrom there we will further customize our visualization with the labs() function to provide a title, axis labels and a caption.\n\ndem_summary &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_summary.csv\")\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = region, y = polyarchy)) + # ggplot call\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + # we use geom_col() for a a bar chart\n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg.

Let’s go ahead and add the reorder() function to our aes() call so that we are reordering the bars based on descending values of the average polyarchy score.\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = reorder(region, -polyarchy), y = polyarchy)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg.

We will use the filter() function from dplyr to select the year 2015. We use the pipe operator (|&gt;) to pass the data frame to the filter() function. We are going to cover the filter() verb and the pipe operator in more detail in the next module, but for now just know that filter() selects a column and the pipe operator allows us to pass the data frame to the next function without having to re-specify it.\nFrom there, we call ggplot(), specifying the polyarchy score on x-axis.

These are already wrangled and saved for you in an object called dem_waves_ctrs.\n📥 Download dem_summary.csv\nLet’s go ahead and download those, save them in the data subfolder for this module and read them into R.\n\ndem_waves_ctrs &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_waves_ctrs.csv\")\n\nNext, we are going to do our ggplot() call.

In this example, we are going to illustrating modernization theory, which predicts a positive relationship between wealth and democracy, while also incorporating levels of women’s representation into our analysis.\nWe are going to start with the dem_women.csv file we used in the last module. We will then group the data by country and calculate the mean for each variable. In the group_by() call we also include region because we will want to keep it so that we can color our points by region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGrouping and summarizing variables will be covered more in a future module, but here just know that we are doing this to get the average of each variable for each country. Another option could be to filter the data for one year, as we did for the histogram in the last module.\n\n\n\ndem_summary_ctry &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_women.csv\") |&gt;\n  group_by(country, region) |&gt; # group by country, keep region\n  summarize(\n    polyarchy = mean(polyarchy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    gdp_pc = mean(gdp_pc, na.rm = TRUE), \n    flfp = mean(flfp, na.rm = TRUE), \n    women_rep = mean(women_rep, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nNow let’s create our first scatter plot. Our ggplot() call looks similar to previous ones except for a few things. First we are calling geom_point() for our geom. But also notice that our aesthetics mapping includes four dimenstions: x, y, color and size. So here we are telling ggplot2 that we want wealth on the x-axis, the polyarchy score on the y-axis, to color the points based on region, and to vary the size of the points in relation to the level of women’s representation.\nOne last thing we want to do is to put our x-axis on a log scale and change the labels to reflect their dollar values. For the log scale, we can use the scale_x_log10() function and for the labels we can use the label_number() function from the scales package. We set the prefix to “$” and the suffix to “k” so that each number on the x-axis starts with a dollar sign and ends with “k” denoting “thousands.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will encounter other useful scales functions including label_dollar() and label_percent() in future lessons.\nNotice that in this example we introduce the scales package by including it as a prefix to the label_number() function, e.g. scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\"). This allows us to use the package without having to load it, e.g. library(scales). It also has the benefit of generating a list of auto-complete suggestions for the many available functions in the scales package.\n\n\n\n# in this ggplot() call we have four dimensions\n# x, y, color, and size\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy, color = region, size = women_rep)) + \n  geom_point() + # use geom_point() for scatter plots\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Region\",\n    size = \"Women Reps\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot does a good job of illustrating the basic point of modernization theory in that we do see the positive correlation between wealth and democracy. But we also see that there are some outliers and that a lot of the outlier countries are concentrated in the Middle East.\nWe also see that the distribution of women’s representation is somewhat orthogonal to wealth and democracy. Most wealthy western countries have high levels of women’s representation, but so do a lot of low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nAdding a trend line\nWe can definitely see a relationship between wealth and democracy in the scatter plot, but how strong is it? One way to find out is to add a trend line. Let’s do this by adding another geom, geom_smooth(), and specifying a linear model with the argument method = \"lm\" We acn also set the linewidth of the trend line to 1 so that the line is more visible.\nIf we want to add a single trend while also maintaining the coloring by region, then we have to reconfigure the ggplot() call a bit. Specifically, we will want to move color = region to a separate aes() call in the geom_point() function, e.g. geom_point(aes(color = region)). If we don’t do this we will get separate trend lines for each region (try it and see!).\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Region\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacet wrapping\nNow let’s imagine that we really interested in drilling down into the “heterogeneous effects” of wealth on democracy by region. In other words, we want to see more clearly how wealth is related to democracy in some regions but not others. For this, we can use facet_wrap() to get a separate chart for each region rather than just shading the points by region. Inside of facet_wrap() we identify region as the variable that we want to use to separate the plots, e.g. facet_wrap(~region). Notice how we have to include a tilde (~) here.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region) +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can clearly see a relationship between wealth and democracy in all of the countries except for the Middle East and Africa. We could speculate that the lack of a relationship in the Middle East could be evidence of an oil curse dynamic whereas perhaps the lack of a relationship in Africa is due to weak institutions.\nThe relationship between wealth and democracy in the West would be apparent, but it is obscured by the fact that western countries because the high wealth and polyarchy values result in extreme bunching in the northwest quadrant of the graph. To deal with this issue, we could add the scales = \"free\" argument to our plot.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut notice there is a bit of a tradeoff here. With the scales = free option set, we now have separate axes for each of the plots. This is less of a clean look than having common x and y axes.\n### Labeling points\nNow let’s try drilling down into one of the regions to get a better sense of what countries are driving the relationship. To do this, we can filter our data set for a region that we are interested in and then add country labels to the points in the scatter plot. Here we are going to filter for “Asia” and we will ad a geom_text() call to add country labels. In the geom_text() call we include arguments for size and vjust to adjust the size and vertical location of the labels relative to the points.\n\ndem_summary_ctry |&gt; \n  filter(region == \"Asia\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_text(aes(label = country), size = 2, vjust = 2) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) +\n    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n      labs(\n        x= \"GDP Per Capita\", \n        y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n        title = \"Wealth and democracy in Asia, 1990 - present\", \n        caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n        )"

Sometimes we collect it ourselves through surveys, or we might use data collected by someone else. Increasingly, data is also available online, either for download or through scraping techniques. In R, we often work with data that comes packaged in libraries, such as unvotes or vdemlite. Many datasets can also be accessed programmatically through application programming interfaces, or APIs. Regardless of the source, the structure and quality of the data are not guaranteed, which brings us to the question of what makes data usable in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\nMany packages ship with their own inbuilt datasets. For example, the ggplot2 package includes the mpg dataset, which contains information about fuel economy for various car models. Similarly dplyr includes the starwars dataset, which contains information about characters from the Star Wars universe.\nTo find out what datasets are included in a package, you can use the data(package = \"package_name\") function. For example, data(package = \"ggplot2\") will list all datasets available in the ggplot2 package. To use the datasets, you can load the package and simply call the dataset by its name, like mpg or starwars."

This means they are organized into rows and columns, and are sometimes referred to as rectangular data. In R, the standard way to represent this kind of data is with a data frame. Each column in the data frame corresponds to a variable or attribute, such as GDP per capita or life expectancy. Each row corresponds to a single unit of observation, such as a country, individual, or point in time.\nA data frame is built around a unit of analysis–the entity or level at which observations are recorded. In a cross-sectional dataset, the units might be countries, states, cities, or individuals at a specific moment. In a time-series dataset, the units are often repeated over time such as countries measured annually from 1990 to 2020. Understanding the unit of analysis is key to interpreting and analyzing data correctly."

    "text": "The Concept of Tidy Data\nTo work effectively with data, especially in the R ecosystem, it is helpful to adhere to a structure known as tidy data. In tidy data, each column is reserved for a single variable, each row contains exactly one observation, and each cell holds a single value. This format aligns with the expectations of many functions in the tidyverse, making the data easier to filter, transform, and visualize. Tidy data is not merely a stylistic preference–it is a convention that supports a consistent and predictable approach to analysis.\n\n\nTidy Data Example\nThe structure of tidy data can be illustrated visually. The image below shows a dataset where each column is a variable, each row is a separate case, and each cell contains a single measurement:\n\n\n\nTidy Data\n\n\nThis clean organization contrasts sharply with the ad hoc formatting often encountered in real-world data files.\n\n\nWhat are Clean Data?\nWhere tidy data is about structure, clean data is about making sure that data are free of errors and inconsistencies that make analysis difficult or misleading. This includes ensuring that column names are not duplicated and are easy to reference in code. It also means that missing values have been addressed, either through imputation or removal. Clean data should not contain extra or blank rows or columns, and all values should be stored in the proper format—for example, dates should be stored as actual date objects rather than character strings. Clean data allow us to trust the integrity of our analysis and avoid downstream issues.\n\n\nMessy Data Example\nTo appreciate the importance of clean data, it helps to examine what happens when data are not clean or tidy. The image below shows an example of messy data—likely extracted from a real-world spreadsheet—where variable names may be repeated, values are spread across multiple columns inappropriately, and the structure does not conform to tidy principles:\n\n\n\nMessy Data\n\n\nThis kind of data requires significant wrangling before it can be used effectively in analysis."

    "text": "Tibbles: A Modern Take on Data Frames\nWe have been talking a lot about data frames as a standard way of storing tabular data in R, where each column represents a variable and each row is an observation. In this section, we introduce tibbles, which are modern reimaginings of data frames designed for use within the tidyverse. While tibbles behave much like data frames, they offer a number of important improvements that make them more predictable and user-friendly.\nTibbles avoid some of the surprising behaviors of base R data frames. For example, they do not automatically convert character strings into factors. They also display data in a more readable way, showing only the first ten rows and as many columns as fit on screen. Column names are preserved exactly as written, even if they contain spaces or other special characters. In general, tibbles are slightly easier to work with than base R data frames when writing scripts or building reproducible workflows.\nWhenever you read data into R using a tidyverse package like readr, the result is automatically returned as a tibble. But you can also create your own tibble from scratch using the tibble() function from the tibble package. Here’s an example that constructs a small tibble containing names, ages, heights, and a logical variable indicating whether someone is a student:\nlibrary(tibble)\n\nmy_tibble &lt;- tibble(\n  name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"),\n  age = c(25, 30, 35),\n  height = c(160, 170, 180),\n  is_student = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)\n)\n\nmy_tibble\nThis tibble contains several different types of data. Each column is stored using an appropriate data type, which R identifies using short labels that appear when printing the tibble. Understanding these types is important because they affect how R interprets and manipulates your data."

    "text": "Working with Dates and Times Using lubridate\nHandling dates and times in R can be tricky, especially when working with data from different sources that use inconsistent formats. The lubridate package simplifies this process by providing a consistent and readable set of functions for parsing, manipulating, and formatting dates and times. Unlike base R, which requires more manual effort to convert character strings into date objects and extract components like year or month, lubridate is designed to make these tasks intuitive.\nOne of the key advantages of lubridate is that its functions are named according to the structure of the date format itself. For example, ymd() expects input in a year-month-day format, while mdy() expects month-day-year. This eliminates the need to specify format strings manually, reducing the chance of error and improving code readability.\nHere’s a quick example showing how to use lubridate to parse dates in multiple formats:\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# Parse dates in different formats\nmy_date &lt;- ymd(\"2024-09-05\")\nmy_date2 &lt;- mdy(\"09-05-2024\")\nmy_date3 &lt;- dmy(\"05-09-2024\")\n\n# Print in long form\nformat(my_date, \"%B %d, %Y\")  # \"September 05, 2024\"\nOnce stored correctly as date objects, these values can be used in filtering, plotting, or date-based calculations without additional conversion steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn!!\n\n\n\n\nCreate your own tibble on a topic that interests you—this could be anything from meals you’ve cooked to books you’ve read or places you’ve visited.\nTry to include at least three different data types, such as character, numeric, and logical.\nInclude a date or date-time column using lubridate to parse your date values.\nUse tibble() to create your tibble and print it to inspect the structure and data types."

The == operator is used for comparison, meaning “equal to.” This is different from the = operator, which is used for assignment in R. When filtering data, we always use == to specify conditions we want to match (not =).\n\n\nThe filter() function can handle multiple conditions using logical operators. Here we used == for “equal to.” But we could also use != (not equal to), &lt; (less than), &gt; (greater than), & (and), and | (or). We can also combine operators to create more complex conditions. For example, if we wanted to filter for flights that occurred in the month of June or earlier, we could write filter(month &lt;= 6). Similarly, to find flights that were delayed by more than 30 minutes, we could use filter(dep_delay &gt; 30). Try experimenting with these operators in the filter() function in the code above to see how they affect the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn!!\n\n\n\n\nUse the filter() function to find all flights that departed from JFK airport.\nFilter the flights that arrived on or after June 1.\nFind flights that arrived before May 1 and were delayed by more than 60 minutes.\nFilter for flights that were operated by American Airlines (carrier code “AA”) or Delta Airlines (carrier code “DL”)."

This is useful for deriving new insights from raw data. For example, we might want to calculate how much time was gained or lost during a flight:\n\nflights |&gt;\n  mutate(time_gain = arr_delay - dep_delay) |&gt;\n  select(flight, dep_delay, arr_delay, time_gain)\n\n# A tibble: 336,776 × 4\n   flight dep_delay arr_delay time_gain\n    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1   1545         2        11         9\n 2   1714         4        20        16\n 3   1141         2        33        31\n 4    725        -1       -18       -17\n 5    461        -6       -25       -19\n 6   1696        -4        12        16\n 7    507        -5        19        24\n 8   5708        -3       -14       -11\n 9     79        -3        -8        -5\n10    301        -2         8        10\n# ℹ 336,766 more rows\n\n\nThis calculation gives us a sense of whether flights tended to recover from delays during their journey. We can also use mutate() to convert units (e.g., minutes to hours), flag particular conditions, or apply mathematical transformations.\nWe can use many different arithmetic operations within mutate(), such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) or exponentiation (^ or **). For example, if we wanted to convert air_time from minutes to hours, we could write mutate(air_time_hours = air_time / 60). Or, if we wanted to square the arr_delay variable, we could write mutate(arr_delay_squared = arr_delay^2) or mutate(arr_delay_squared = arr_delay ** 2). We will use arithmetic operators in the context of mutate a lot in the course, so it’s worth practicing with different operations to see how they work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn!!\n\n\n\n\nUse the mutate() function to create a new variable called total_delay that sums dep_delay and arr_delay.\nCreate a new variable called air_time_hours that converts air_time from minutes to hours.\nAdd a new variable called flight_speed that calculates the average speed of the flight in miles per hour, assuming the distance is given in miles and after converting air time into hours."

Let’s summarize the polyarchy score, a widely used measure of electoral democracy.\n\nsummarizedem(indicator = \"v2x_polyarchy\")\n\n\n\n\nSummary of v2x_polyarchy by Country\nYears: 1970 - 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you can use fetchdem() to retrieve a subset of the data filtered by indicators, countries, and years.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndem_indicators &lt;- fetchdem(\n  indicators = c(\"v2x_polyarchy\", \"v2xel_frefair\"),                   \n  start_year = 2000, end_year = 2020,\n  countries = c(\"USA\", \"SWE\")\n  )\n\nglimpse(dem_indicators)\n\nRows: 42\nColumns: 6\n$ country_name    &lt;chr&gt; \"Sweden\", \"Sweden\", \"Sweden\", \"Sweden\", \"Sweden\", \"Swe…\n$ country_text_id &lt;chr&gt; \"SWE\", \"SWE\", \"SWE\", \"SWE\", \"SWE\", \"SWE\", \"SWE\", \"SWE\"…\n$ country_id      &lt;dbl&gt; 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, …\n$ year            &lt;dbl&gt; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, …\n$ v2x_polyarchy   &lt;dbl&gt; 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.915, 0.915, 0.915, 0.915, 0.916…\n$ v2xel_frefair   &lt;dbl&gt; 0.962, 0.962, 0.962, 0.963, 0.963, 0.963, 0.963, 0.965…\n\n\nHere, fetchdem includes filtering arguments for indicators, countries, and years. We could also have used the dplyr select() and filter() verbs to narrow down the data after fetching it, and this is actually what is going on “under the hood.” These fetchdem() arguments just make it easier to work with the data without having to write a lot of code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn!\n\n\n\n\nUse searchdem() to find an indicator of interest.\nUse summarizedem() to view its summary statistics.\nUse fetchdem() to download that variable for a country or set of countries."

    "text": "Grouping and Summarizing\n\nLet’s use the V-Dem data to illustrate how to group and summarize data. One of the most common sequences in data wrangling involves group_by(), followed by summarize(), and then arrange() to sort the results.\nWe can start by downloading some data for all of the countries. Let’s download the polyarchy score (v2x_polyarchy), along with V-Dem’s liberal democracy score (v2x_libdem), a women’s political empowerment index (v2x_gender) and per capital gdp (v2x_gdp_pc). Let’s also download the region of each country (e_regionpol_6C) so that we can have something to group and summarize by.\nLet’s then save those data in a data frame called democracy and let’s then pipe the data into the rename function so that we can have more intuitive names for our variables.\n\ndemocracy &lt;- \n  fetchdem(\n    indicators = c(\n      \"v2x_polyarchy\", \n      \"v2x_libdem\", \n      \"v2x_gender\", \n      \"e_gdppc\", \n      \"e_regionpol_6C\"\n      ) \n    ) |&gt;\n    rename(\n      polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy,\n      libdem = v2x_libdem,\n      womens_emp = v2x_gender,\n      gdp_pc = e_gdppc,\n      region = e_regionpol_6C\n    )\n\nglimpse(democracy)\n\nRows: 9,170\nColumns: 9\n$ country_name    &lt;chr&gt; \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mex…\n$ country_text_id &lt;chr&gt; \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\"…\n$ country_id      &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, …\n$ year            &lt;dbl&gt; 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, …\n$ polyarchy       &lt;dbl&gt; 0.250, 0.248, 0.249, 0.249, 0.251, 0.251, 0.262, 0.276…\n$ libdem          &lt;dbl&gt; 0.111, 0.110, 0.111, 0.111, 0.111, 0.111, 0.115, 0.123…\n$ womens_emp      &lt;dbl&gt; 0.421, 0.421, 0.421, 0.426, 0.426, 0.433, 0.446, 0.454…\n$ gdp_pc          &lt;dbl&gt; 7.890, 8.082, 8.463, 8.845, 9.189, 9.480, 9.673, 9.914…\n$ region          &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, …\n\n\nNotice here that we are just downloading the data for these variables for all of the years and all of the countries. We are not using the countries or years arguments, so we get all of the data.\nAlso notice that the region variable is a series of region codes. This is going to make it hard to understand what the regions are, so we will need to do some additional work to make this more interpretable. Let’s call mutate() along with case_match() to create a new variable that classifies countries into named regions based on the e_regionpol_6C variable. We will save the new data frame as democracy again, overwriting the previous version.\n\ndemocracy &lt;- democracy |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    region = case_match(region, # replace the values with country names\n                     1 ~ \"Eastern Europe\", \n                     2 ~ \"Latin America\",  \n                     3 ~ \"Middle East\",   \n                     4 ~ \"Africa\", \n                     5 ~ \"The West\", \n                     6 ~ \"Asia\")\n  )\n\nglimpse(democracy)\n\nRows: 9,170\nColumns: 9\n$ country_name    &lt;chr&gt; \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mex…\n$ country_text_id &lt;chr&gt; \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\"…\n$ country_id      &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, …\n$ year            &lt;dbl&gt; 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, …\n$ polyarchy       &lt;dbl&gt; 0.250, 0.248, 0.249, 0.249, 0.251, 0.251, 0.262, 0.276…\n$ libdem          &lt;dbl&gt; 0.111, 0.110, 0.111, 0.111, 0.111, 0.111, 0.115, 0.123…\n$ womens_emp      &lt;dbl&gt; 0.421, 0.421, 0.421, 0.426, 0.426, 0.433, 0.446, 0.454…\n$ gdp_pc          &lt;dbl&gt; 7.890, 8.082, 8.463, 8.845, 9.189, 9.480, 9.673, 9.914…\n$ region          &lt;chr&gt; \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"La…\n\n\nOnce we have the data ready, we can summarize these variables by region. Below we have an example of how to group the data by region, summarize the average democracy score, the median libdem score, the standard deviation of womens_emp, and the minimum value of gdp_pc. We then arrange the results in descending order of the average democracy score.\n\ndemocracy |&gt;\n  group_by(region) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    polyarchy_mean = mean(polyarchy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    libdem_median = median(libdem, na.rm = TRUE),\n    womens_emp_sd = sd(womens_emp, na.rm = TRUE),\n    gdp_pc_min = min(gdp_pc, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(polyarchy_mean))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  region         polyarchy_mean libdem_median womens_emp_sd gdp_pc_min\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 The West                0.846         0.802         0.101      4.04 \n2 Latin America           0.532         0.401         0.201      1.19 \n3 Eastern Europe          0.475         0.338         0.161      1.47 \n4 Asia                    0.354         0.212         0.193      0.726\n5 Africa                  0.315         0.143         0.205      0.286\n6 Middle East             0.213         0.118         0.183      1.49 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Detail: na.rm = TRUE\n\n\n\nNote how we add na.rm = TRUE to the mean(), median(), and sd() functions. This is important because it tells R to ignore any missing values (NAs) when calculating these statistics. If you don’t include this argument, R will return NA for the entire summary if any of the values are missing.\n\n\nThis pattern — group, summarize, arrange — is at the core of many descriptive analyses. You’re grouping the data by a categorical variable (region), summarizing one or more numeric variables (e.g., polyarchy, libdem), and then sorting the results to highlight interesting patterns.\nWhat if we wanted to get the same summary statistics for multiple variables at once? To do this, we can use the across() function within summarize(). This allows us to apply the same function (like mean(), median(), etc.) to multiple columns without repeating code.\n\ndemocracy |&gt;\n  group_by(region) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    across(\n      c(polyarchy, libdem, womens_emp, gdp_pc),\n           mean,\n           na.rm = TRUE,\n           .names = \"mean_{col}\"\n      )\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(mean_polyarchy))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  region         mean_polyarchy mean_libdem mean_womens_emp mean_gdp_pc\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 The West                0.846       0.776           0.867       31.5 \n2 Latin America           0.532       0.392           0.656        8.37\n3 Eastern Europe          0.475       0.357           0.739       11.6 \n4 Asia                    0.354       0.265           0.557        7.38\n5 Africa                  0.315       0.215           0.537        3.83\n6 Middle East             0.213       0.165           0.422       20.7 \n\n\nHere we are grouping the data by region and then summarizing the mean of several indicators: polyarchy, libdem, women_rep, and flfp. The .names = \"mean_{col}\" argument allows us to create new column names that include the original variable names, prefixed with “mean_”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn!\n\n\n\n\nFind a few indicators of interest in vdemlite using searchdem().\nUse summarizedem() to view their summary statistics.\nUse fetchdem() to download the data for those indicators and region codes that you can use to group the data, filtering for a subset of years if you like, but retaining all of the countries.
